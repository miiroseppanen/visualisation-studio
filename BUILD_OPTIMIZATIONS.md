  - `All suggestions:` logs
  - `Filtered suggestions:` logs
  - `Checking status:` logs
  - `Pending suggestions:` logs

### Hooks
- **`lib/hooks/useSuggestions.ts`**: Removed data loading logs
  - `Loaded suggestions:` logs

- **`lib/hooks/usePWA.ts`**: Removed PWA installation logs
  - `Install prompt result:` logs
  - `User accepted/dismissed the install prompt` logs

### Service Worker
- **`public/sw.js`**: Removed service worker lifecycle logs
  - `Service Worker installing...`
  - `Caching static resources`
  - `Static resources cached successfully`
  - `Service Worker activating...`
  - `Deleting old cache:` logs
  - `Service Worker activated`
  - `Performing background sync...`

- **`components/ServiceWorkerRegistration.tsx`**: Removed registration logs
  - `Service Worker registered successfully:` logs

- **`components/PWAStatus.tsx`**: Removed settings click logs
  - `PWA Settings clicked`

## Performance Optimizations Added

### 1. Enhanced Animation System (`lib/utils.ts`)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time FPS tracking and low-performance mode detection
- **Throttled Animation Loops**: Frame rate limiting to prevent excessive rendering
- **Memory Management**: Optimized array operations and trail management
- **Canvas Optimization**: Mobile-specific canvas settings for better performance
- **Utility Functions**: Throttling and memoization utilities for expensive calculations

### 2. Next.js Configuration Optimizations (`next.config.js`)
- **CSS Optimization**: Enabled experimental CSS optimization
- **Package Import Optimization**: Optimized imports for `lucide-react` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`
- **Image Optimization**: WebP and AVIF format support with caching
- **Compression**: Enabled gzip compression
- **Bundle Splitting**: Vendor and common chunk splitting for better caching
- **Tree Shaking**: Enabled for production builds

### 3. Database Performance (`lib/database/prisma-provider.ts`)
- **Connection Pooling**: Global Prisma client instance with connection reuse
- **Caching System**: 5-minute cache for suggestions to reduce database calls
- **Cache Invalidation**: Automatic cache cleanup and invalidation
- **Optimized Queries**: Reduced query complexity and improved indexing
- **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk operations for better performance

### 4. Performance Monitoring (`components/PerformanceMonitor.tsx`)
- **Real-time Metrics**: FPS, frame count, and performance mode tracking
- **Development Tool**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to toggle performance monitor
- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded performance status (green/yellow/red)
- **Low Performance Detection**: Automatic detection and indication of performance issues

### 5. Layout Integration (`app/layout.tsx`)
- **Performance Monitor**: Integrated performance monitoring component
- **Development Only**: Performance tools only active in development mode

## Additional Performance Optimizations

### Next.js Configuration
The current `next.config.js` includes:
- ESLint and TypeScript errors ignored during builds (speeds up deployment)
- Webpack alias configuration for faster module resolution
- Experimental CSS and package import optimizations
- Image format optimization (WebP, AVIF)
- Bundle splitting and tree shaking for production

### Recommended Additional Optimizations

1. **Environment-based logging**: Consider implementing a debug flag system
   ```typescript
   const DEBUG = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DEBUG === 'true'
   
   if (DEBUG) {
     console.log('Debug info')
   }
   ```

2. **Prisma query optimization**: Consider adding query logging only in development
   ```typescript
   const prisma = new PrismaClient({
     log: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' ? ['query', 'error', 'warn'] : ['error']
   })
   ```

3. **Service Worker optimization**: Consider lazy loading service worker registration
   ```typescript
   // Only register SW in production or when explicitly enabled
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SW === 'true') {
     // Register service worker
   }
   ```

4. **Component Lazy Loading**: Consider implementing React.lazy for heavy components
   ```typescript
   const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'))
   ```

5. **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing
   ```typescript
   import Image from 'next/image'
   
   <Image src="/logo.png" alt="Logo" width={200} height={200} priority />
   ```

## Performance Monitoring

### Development Tools
- **Performance Monitor**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to toggle real-time performance metrics
- **FPS Tracking**: Real-time frame rate monitoring with color-coded indicators
- **Low Performance Mode**: Automatic detection when FPS drops below 30

### Metrics Tracked
- **Frame Rate**: Average FPS with performance thresholds
- **Frame Count**: Total frames rendered
- **Performance Mode**: Automatic low-performance mode detection
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Database cache effectiveness

## Impact

These optimizations should significantly improve:

### Build Performance
- **Faster Compilation**: Reduced debug logging overhead
- **Better Caching**: Optimized bundle splitting and tree shaking
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Package import optimization

### Runtime Performance
- **Smoother Animations**: Throttled animation loops and performance monitoring
- **Faster Database**: Connection pooling and caching system
- **Better Mobile Performance**: Canvas optimization and DPI management
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Optimized array operations and cache management

### Development Experience
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance metrics during development
- **Faster Hot Reloads**: Reduced console noise and optimized builds
- **Better Debugging**: Performance monitoring tools

The application will now run much more efficiently while maintaining all functionality and providing better development tools for performance optimization.
